# Selecting Windows for KS2
XOS win10 | win11

HypeOS

SystemX win10

__changes in 2025 will be due to the departure of Win10__

# How to optimize KS2?
- Be sure to test "**disable under-screen optimization**" and **on**


- in order to optimize the game we need a reg file and PC settings

ok, in order for the game to be without small friezes, take this tweak which is in releases
This tweak turns off the cs2 overlay so you can play without freezes

- remove all the checkboxes here and leave two checkmarks as in the screenshot
- Itâ€™s better to disable QoS, thereâ€™s no point

# Questions
What is the overlay in CS2?

The CS2 overlay is a part of the interface that opens on top of almost any game running on Steam. It allows the user to access the friends list, browser, chat and in-game purchases.

Why optimization?

Optimization - optimizes Windows, speeds up performance and reduces latency/response
# Problems
who has a video card below 1000 series
It's better not to use tweaks
will make things worse

# Good commands to increase FPS
- engine_low_latency_sleep_after_client_tick true
- fps_max 0
- rate 10000000
- sometimes you need to clean the console, write:
- alias C "clear; clearall; clear_bombs"
# Result of Optimization of CS2

rate 10000000 
(Makes the mouse and server response better)
# The end
What have we achieved during this time?
We have made more frames in cs2 for a smooth game

after restarting the pc, fps will be added every day when it is added, it will already finish that it has scored its amount for CS2
# Support for hard work
