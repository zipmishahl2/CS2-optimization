# How to optimize CS2?
- in order to optimize the game we need a reg file and settings [PC](https://github.com/zipmishahl2/CS2-optimization/releases/download/optimizaton/cs2.optimizaton.rar)

ok, in order for the game to be without small friezes, take this tweak which is in releases
This tweak turns off the cs2 overlay so you can play without freezes

- remove all the checkboxes here and leave two checkmarks as in the screenshot
- Itâ€™s better to disable QoS, thereâ€™s no point

2. Settings -> Game -> Game - set Buffering to smooth out packet losses to either 1 or 2 packets (test).

# Questions
What is the overlay in CS2?

The CS2 overlay is a part of the interface that opens on top of almost any game running on Steam. It allows the user to access the friends list, browser, chat and in-game purchases.

Why optimization?

Optimization - optimizes Windows, speeds up performance and reduces latency/response
# Problems
who has a video card below 1000 series
It's better not to use tweaks
will make things worse

# Good commands
- engine_low_latency_sleep_after_client_tick true
- fps_max 0
- rate 10000000
- sometimes you need to clean the console, write:
- alias C "clear; clearall; clear_bombs"
- cl_usenewbob false
- cl_hud_telemetry_serverrecvmargin_graph_show

# Result of Optimization of CS2
![low_latency_cs2_command](https://github.com/zipmishahl2/CS2-optimization/assets/110753825/ea288671-c6a5-4899-9514-ff649cea853d)

rate 10000000 
(Makes the mouse and server response better)
# The end
What have we achieved during this time?
We have made more frames in cs2 for a smooth game

after restarting the pc, fps will be added every day when it is added, it will already finish that it has scored its amount for CS2
