## Disclaimer

Before using the optimization package, we recommend that you carefully read the disclaimer:

Please note that we cannot guarantee an FPS boost from applying our optimizations, every system + configuration is different.
Everything is "use at your own risk", we are if you damage your system in any way
 (ex. not following the disclaimers carefully).
If you don't know what a tweak is, do not use it and contact our support team to receive more assistance.
Even though we have an automatic restore point feature, we highly recommend making a manual restore point before running.
